%description
ROS-Industrial support for the ABB IRB 5400 (and variants). This package
contains configuration data, 3D models and launch files for ABB IRB 5400
manipulators. This currently includes the base model. Joint limits and max joint
velocities are based on the information in the ABB data sheets. All URDFs /
XACROs are based on the default motion and joint velocity limits, unless noted
otherwise (ie: no support for high speed joints, extended / limited motion
ranges or other options). Before using any of the configuration files and / or
meshes included in this package, be sure to check they are correct for the
particular robot model and configuration you intend to use them with.
