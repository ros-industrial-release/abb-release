# ABB IRB2600 Support Package

## Supported Variants

This package currently supports the 165cm (short arm) and 185cm (longer arm)
reach variants of the ABB IRB2600 including both the 12kg and 20kg payloads.

For the 165cm variant specifically, both the 12kg and 20kg payload variants
are supported. From a ROS-I perspective, there is no difference between the
robots with these two payloads so they are both supported by the
`irb2600_12_165` variant.
