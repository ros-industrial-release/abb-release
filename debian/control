Description: ROS-Industrial support for the ABB IRB 6640 (and variants).
 This package contains configuration data, 3D models and launch files for ABB IRB 6640 manipulators. This currently includes the IRB 6640-185/2.8m (6640-185) only. Joint limits and max joint velocities are based on the information in the ABB IRB 6640 technical data sheet (Version: 3HAC 028284-001 Rev. N). All urdfs / xacros are based on the default motion and joint velocity limits, unless noted otherwise (ie: no support for high speed joints, extended / limited motion ranges or other options). Before using any of the configuration files and / or meshes included in this package, be sure to check they are correct for the particular robot model and configuration you intend to use them with.
