Description: ROS-Industrial support for the ABB IRB 4600 (and variants).
 This package contains configuration data, 3D models and launch files for ABB IRB 4600 manipulators. This currently includes the 20/2.50, the 40/2.55 and the 60/2.05 variants. Joint limits and max joint velocities are based on the information in the ABB IRB 4600 Product Specification, 3HAC032885-001, Rev Z. All urdfs / xacros are based on the default motion and joint velocity limits, unless noted otherwise (ie: no support for high speed joints, extended / limited motion ranges or other options). Before using any of the configuration files and / or meshes included in this package, be sure to check they are correct for the particular robot model and configuration you intend to use them with.
