Description: ROS-Industrial support for the ABB IRB 6700 (and variants).
 This package contains configuration data, 3D models and launch files for ABB IRB 6700 manipulators. This currently includes the 200/2.60 and 235/2.65 variants. Joint limits and max joint velocities are based on the information in the ABB IRB 6700 product specification document All URDFs / XACROs are based on the default motion and joint velocity limits, unless noted otherwise (ie: no support for high speed joints, extended / limited motion ranges or other options). Before using any of the configuration files and / or meshes included in this package, be sure to check they are correct for the particular robot model and configuration you intend to use them with.
