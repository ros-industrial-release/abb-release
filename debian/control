Description: ROS-Industrial support for the ABB IRB 4400 (and variants).
 This package contains configuration data, 3D models and launch files for ABB IRB 4400 manipulators. This currently includes the L30. Joint limits and max joint velocities are based on the information in the ABB IRB 4400 product specification document (Article No: 3HAC 8770-1). All urdfs / xacros are based on the default motion and joint velocity limits, unless noted otherwise (ie: no support for high speed joints, extended / limited motion ranges or other options). Before using any of the configuration files and / or meshes included in this package, be sure to check they are correct for the particular robot model and configuration you intend to use them with.
